# Distributed System and Cloud Computing - Fall 2017
----------
Labs from Distributed System and Cloud Computing course

This repository contains Jypyter notebook python codes from that course, taught at EURECOM, by prof. Pietro Michiardi, in Fall 2017.

The 3 labs' topics were:
1. Stochastic Gradient Descent
2. K-Means
3. Spark SQL

All notebooks use known data analytics algorithms using MapReduce and cloud computing.

## Details
* _Language_: Python over Jupyter Notebooks.
* _Execution_: set over a remote Spark cluster in [EURECOM](http://www.eurecom.fr/fr), managed by [Zoe](http://zoe-analytics.eu/)
* _Libraries_: pyspark, numpy, matplotlib

## Authors 
* Albane Bonnaud
* Kim-Anh-Nhi Nguyen @kanguyn

## Motivation
Deep Learning is a new approach in Machine Learning which allows to build models that have shown superior performance fora wide range of applications, in particular Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Thanks to the joint availability of large data corpus and affordable processing power, Deep Learning has revived the old field  of Artificial Neural Networks and provoked the "Renaissance" of AI (Artificial Intelligence).  The present notebooks will address this topic, implementing from scratch and using well known libraries, Deep Neural Networks.

## Sources and acknowledgments
The initial assignments come from the course in [Distributed System and Cloud Computing](http://www.eurecom.fr/en/course/Clouds-2017Fall) taught in EURECOM by [Pietro Michiardi](https://github.com/michiard)

The notebooks have been crafted mainly by their authors, following well known open source documentation for the different libraries used and the material from the course.

The notebooks are based on publicly available data.
